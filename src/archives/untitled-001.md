# Untitle 001

<div class="text-center">

I'm smiling like a mad man

I'm singing like a bird

I'm thinking of the day

When she's the one I hold.

- - -

If she's the first one I see

And the last one I hear

Each and every day

I'll have nothing to fear.

- - -

I may sound crazy

It may seem absurd

But I wish in each star

And pray to the Lord...

- - -

*"Please let this be real,*

*Let this be Your plan.*

*The girl who I wrote this for*

*Please let me be her man."*
