# White Dragon's Blood
### The Departure

> **DATE** Jan 29
>
> **LOCATION** Saltsong

A female figure bursts into a humble building at the center of town. Her backpack is almost bursting but several cooking pans, pieces of maple wood, and a bedroll are still strapped to it. She also has her longbow and quiver within easy reach.

```
    FEMALE FIGHTER
    Are you coming with me or not?

    MALE
    I want to but who will take care of the temple?

    FEMALE FIGHTER
    If we don't go now, we will lose everything. And that includes this temple!
```

His gaze falls on the floor, his shoulders slumps, and he sighs in resignation. He turns around and, while holding the amulet around his neck close to his lips, says a silent prayer.

```
    MALE CLERIC (WHISPERING)
    Dear Apollo, please help us on our quest.

    FEMALE FIGHTER
    I will leave with or without you in an hour.

    MALE CLERIC
    I will be ready by then. Let's meet at the gate.
```

She walks out and heads to the market. If he is coming, they will need more food for the journey.

She is now standing near the town's gate and the hour is almost up.

```
    FEMALE FIGHTER (TO HERSELF)
    Where is he?! Did he change his mind?

    MALE
    Hey Franz! Where are you going? Skipping town too?

    FRANZ
    Shut up! I'll die before I forsake this town.

    MALE
    Oh, sorry. I just thought...

    FRANZ
    Well, you thought wrong!

    MALE
    I'm sorry. I hope you can do something to save our town.
```

The man walks faster towards the market while holding a young deer over his shoulder. He squints and shields his eyes as an armoured man walks by.

```
    MALE CLERIC
    I'm sorry, it is not easy to put this on.
```

She hands him half a dozen rations.

```
    MALE CLERIC
    Thank you, Ate Francine.

    FRANCINE
    Are you sure about this, Mikael?

    MIKAEL
    You are right, we will lose everything if we don't do this.

    MIKAEL (HOLDING HIS AMULET)
    I'm sure Apollo will not let that happen. We will get what we need.

    FRANCINE
    I really hope you are right, I really hope Apollo will help us.
```

They walk outside the town into the waiting coach cab. Francine seats beside the driver while Mikael takes the last seat inside. He bows and smiles as he takes his seat.

```
    FRANCINE (WHISPERING)
    Sorry for the wait.

    DRIVER (WHISPERING)
    Don't worry about it, we will all thank you if and when you come back.
    
    DRIVER (SHOUTING)
    Hold on everyone. Ya!
