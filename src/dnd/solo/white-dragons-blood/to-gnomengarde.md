# White Dragon's Blood
### To Gnomengarde

> **DATE** Feb 06, around noon
>
> **LOCATION** South of Phandalin
>
> Where is the dragon? Tower of Storms
> > `[1d20] = 17`
>
> Do they see or hear anything while passing south of Phandalin? No
> > `Mythic 50/50, [1d100] = 54`

Francine and Mikael walk to the southern part of the town with the intent of reaching the mountains and then walking along its foot to try and find Gnomengarde.

> Where is the dragon? Dragon Barrow
> > `[1d20] = 4`

They stumble upon a stream that is coming out of a concavity carved by a waterfall in the mountain's side. Walking inside, the place is dark even though the sun is at its highest. A combination of plant life and mountain features block any light from getting in. Once their eyes adjusted, they see small islands surrounded by a pool of water with big, colorful mushrooms growing on them. They also notice multiple cave entrances, all perched atop sheer, rocky slopes.

```
    FRANCINE
    I'll climb first, I'll pull you up once I'm at the top.
```

> Was she able to climb? Yes
> > `Athletics check: [1d20 + 1] 20 + 1 = 21 vs DC 13`

She easily scales the 30ft slope. She raises her hands with five fingers all spread out and checks the area. Right from where she's standing, she can see two figures who seems to be sleeping. She spends a second or two to check if they sensed her but they didn't show any reaction.

She goes back to the edge of the slope, signals Mikael to be quiet, and throws down some rope.

> Was he able to climb? Yes
> > `Athletics check with advantage: [1d20 + 2] 4|13 + 2 = 15 vs DC 13`

He catches his breath upon reaching level ground. After giving him a moment, she taps his shoulder points to the sleeping figures.

```
    FRANCINE (WHISPERING)
    How do you want to approach this?

    MIKAEL (WHISPERING)
    Can we at least try waking them up and talking to them first?
```

She nods but takes a step, one hand clutching her bow on her back and the other inches away from her quiver. He takes a step forward into the entrance and sees six more sleeping figures.

```
    MIKAEL (SHOUTING)
    Excuse us.

    MALE GNOME (SHOUTING)
    Who are you?! What are you doing here?!
```

All the other gnomes have their arms outstreched and pointed to Mikael.

```
    MIKAEL
    I'm very sorry. My name is Mikael and behind me is my sister, Francine. We mean no harm, we just need help defeating a dragon.
```

Hearing "dragon", they all lower their hands and look at one another. The male gnome then steps forward.

```
    MALE GNOME (LOOKING UP)
    I am Zook. Is it normal for you to barge in to other people's bedrooms?

    MIKAEL (KNEELING DOWN)
    Again, I'm very sorry. This was the closest entrance we could find.

    ZOOK
    You startled us, that's all. I can't remember the last time we got any human visitors here. Anyway, if you want some help, our best inventors are Fibblestib and Dabbledob. Let me take you to them.
```

Zook walks ahead to the next room, behind him is Mikael and Francine. As soon as Francine is out of sight, the rest of gnomes go back to sleep.

```
    ZOOK
    Sorry, they are fighting again. They are both geniuses but they always want to do it in their own way.

    (speaking in Gnomish)
    Hey! We have some visitors. Says they are here to defeat the dragon.
```

Two gnomes, a female and a male, look at Zook and quickly to Mikael and Francine.

```
    MALE GNOME (GNOMISH)
    Who are these? And why are they in there?

    ZOOK (GNOMISH)
    Haven't I suggested that we make the entrance bigger? They could have walked through that instead of climbing in.

    (speaking in Common)
    These are Mikael and Francine.

    (looks back)
    That one is Fibblestib and that is Dabbledob.

    DABBLEDOB
    That dragon is not a problem for us, we are safe in here.

    FIBBLESTIB
    And we have more pressing problems to attend to. If you can help us with our problem then maybe we can help you after.
```

Dabbledob and Fibblestib return to arguing in Gnomish. Zook looks back to Francine and Mikael.

```
    MIKAEL
    What problem are they referring to?

    ZOOK
    One of our kings has lost his mind, he keeps talking about a "shapechanger". He has locked himself and our other king in their bedroom.

    MIKAEL
    A shapechanger?

    ZOOK
    That's all I know.

    MIKAEL
    Can we talk to your king?

    ZOOK (GNOMISH)
    Hey! They want to talk King Korboz.

    FIBBLESTIB (COMMON)
    Come with me.
```

They walk up a flight of stairs and narrow corridor before arriving at a door.

```
    FIBBLESTIB (COMMON)
    Sire, we have visitors.

    KING KORBOZ (COMMON)
    Are you sure they are not shapechangers?

    MIKAEL (INTERRUPTS FIBBLESTIB)
    Good day King Korboz! We are humans who have come to Phandalin to defeat a dragon. We are here to ask for your help but it seems you have problems of your own. Maybe we can help each other?

    KING KORBOZ
    Bring me proof that you have taken care of the shapechanger and we will help you defeat the dragon.

    MIKAEL
    Can you share more information about this shapechanger?

    KING KORBOZ
    It can change shape. What else do you need?

    MIKAEL
    What shapes have you seen it take? Can it become a gnome or a human? Or an object?

    KING KORBOZ (IRRITATED)
    It can change shape! Now go and take care of it!

    MIKAEL
    I'm afraid we need a bit more information than that.
```
Mikael casts `Guidance` on himself as he tries to persuade the king.

> Was he able to persuade King Korboz? Yes
> > `Persuasion check: [1d20 + 1d4] 15 + 1 = 16 vs DC 12`

```
    KING KORBOZ
    Fibblestib, are you there?

    FIBBLESTIB
    Yes, I am here sire.

    KING KORBOZ
    Prepare some food for our guests but leave them there.

    FIBBLESTIB (CONFUSED)
    Yes, sire.
```

The king waits for a few seconds.

```
    KING KORBOZ
    Is he gone?

    MIKAEL
    Yes.

    KING KORBOZ
    The rug in the throne room almost killed me when I stepped on it. We also haven't seen Orryn and Warryn in the last tenday, I believe that shapechanger is responsible for that as well. I can't lose Gnerkli, please kill it!

    FRANCINE (WHISPERING)
    Then it can be anything around us.

    MIKAEL (WHISPERING)
    Or them.

    (talks through the door)
    Are you sure you are safe in there?

    KING KORBOZ
    Yes! But it's still out there.

    MIKAEL
    We'll see what we can do.
```

After some time, Fibblestib returns with some green bread and mushroom wine. He offers it to Francine and Mikael. They both quickly take a sip of the wine and a bite of the bread to show appreciation.

```
    MIKAEL
    Can you assist us into each and every room here? I think we have a way to flush out this shapechanger.

    FIBBLESTIB
    I'm afraid that's not possible. You are our guests but you are not allowed...

    KING KORBOZ (INTERRUPTS FIBBLESTIB)
    Assist them!

    FIBBLESTIB (AFRAID AND CONFUSED)
    Yes sire.

    (looks to Francine and Mikael)
    Follow me.
```

They start in the throne room. The plan is for Mikael to cast `Thaumaturgy` on himself (to increase the volume of his voice) and `Guidance` on Francine to help her sense any reaction from the objects in the room

```
    MIKAEL (SHOUTING)
    In the name of Apollo, I command you to show your true form!
```

Nothing happens. They assume this means the shapechanger isn't there and they move on to the next room. They repeat the same process room to room until they reach a room that looks to be a cellar. The room has barrels of wines, four of them already tapped and eight more left untouched.

Mikael, huffing and puffing a little bit, prepares to do the same thing again.

```
    MIKAEL (SHOUTING)
    In the name of Apollo, I command you to show your true form!
```

> Did Francine notice anything? No
> > `DC 7 = 6 + 1 [6 + 1d6]`
> >
> > `Perception check: [1d20 + 1d4 + 2] 1 + 3 + 2 = 6 vs DC 7`
>
> Did Mikael notice anything? Yes
> > `Perception check with disadvantage: [1d20 + 3] 17|14 + 3 = 17 vs DC 7`

One of the barrels moved a teeny tiny bit in response to the loud voice. Francine missed it but, luckily, Mikael was focused on that specific barrel as he was shouting.

```
    MIKAEL (TRYING TO WHISPER)
    There!
```

With his shield and mace ready, he walks to the barrel and speaks again. Seeing this, Francine readies draws her bow and points it to the barrel. Fibblestib, already some distance from the siblings, moves farther back.

```
    MIKAEL (SHOUTING)
    In the name of Apollo, show your true form or be stricken down!
```

> Was he able to intimadate whatever the barrel really is? No
> > `Intimidation check: [1d20 + 0] 11 + 0 = 11 vs DC 15`

```
    BARREL
    I do not answer to any god!
```

Tentacles sprout from the bottom of the barrel, the middle splits in half exposing a gaping maw, and the mimic shows its true form. Fibblestib is shouting as he runs away from the fight.

:::

With arrows sticking out, half of its body burnt, and some of its tentacles still squirming on the floor, the mimic is no more. Francine pulls out of her on arrows and, as she expected, purple bits and pieces clinged to it.

```
    FRANCINE
    This should be enough to prove that we killed it.
```

The siblings walk back to the kings' bedroom. They see Fibblestib peeking behind a wall.

```
    MIKAEL
    Don't worry, we've taken care of it. Can you accompany us to the kings' bedroom?
```

Fibblestib slowly walks up, sees the arrow, and leads them back to the bedroom.

```
    MIKAEL
    Sire, we've done it and we have proof.

    FIBBLESTIB
    They killed it sire! I saw everything!

    KING KORBOZ
    They have killed the shapechanger?!
```

The door bursts open and, for the first time, they see the gnome king. He is wearing a metal crown and a cloak. Francine shows him the arrow and he takes it, gives it a closer inspection, and shouts.

```
    KING KORBOZ (SHOUTING)
    Dabbledob!

    DABBLEDOB
    Yes, sire?

    KING KORBOZ
    Can you identify what this is?
```

He hands the arrow to Fibblestib and Dabbledob. Fibblestib smells it and immediately pushes it back. Dabbledob pokes it with one of her tools.

```
    KING KORBOZ
    Well? What is it?

    DABBLEDOB
    Tt certainly looks organic, possibly magical like a shapechanger.

    FIBBLESTIB
    It is! I saw one of the barrels transform. It became a huge mouth!

    KING KORBOZ
    That's exactly it! A huge mouth that can easily swallow a gnome whole!
```

The king shudders a little bit then lets out a big sigh of relief. He runs back into the room, rummages for something, and another could be heard from the inside.

```
    KING GNERKLI
    You are mad! You are crazy!

    KING KORBOZ
    The shapechanger is real. You, tell him.
```

He points to Francine and the siblings tell him everything. They then walk back to the cellar where a lot of gnomes are now congregating. As soon as the kings come into view, they scatter and give way.

Most of the purple goo has now seeped through the cracks on the floor but enough of it remain for the kings to be convinced.

```
    KING GNERKLI
    You were telling the truth!
```

And the kings hug each other.

- - -

The kings called for a feast (of green bread and mushroom wine) to honor the adventurers and everyone is now cramped into the gnomes dining room.

```
    KING KORBOZ
    To Francine and Mikael!

    KING GNERKLI & ALL OTHER GNOMES (IN UNISON)
    To Francine and Mikael!

    KING KORBOZ
    Fibblestib, Dabbledob, under our bed is a chest. Get its contents and give them to Francine and Mikael.

    KING GNERKLI
    And get some things from the treasury as well. Anything that might be useful in their quest.

    FIBBLESTIB & DABBLEDOB (IN UNISON)
    Yes sire.
