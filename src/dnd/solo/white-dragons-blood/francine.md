### The Deal

```
        WARLOCK
        Just one small favor, that's all it costs.

        FRANCINE
        What favor?

        WARLOCK
        I'm not sure, really. I don't need anything right now.
```

Francine has her arms crossed while scrutinizing the person across the table. Unkempt hair, skinny body, and tattered clothes, everything points to him ***not*** being the person she's seeking.

```
        FRANCINE
        Are you sure you can do it?

        WARLOCK
        Of course! Are you doubting my power?

        FRANCINE
        I don't mean to be rude but... you don't look like a warlock to me.
```

As soon as she finishes her sentence, a sprite appears at his side. Instinctively, she reaches for her bow.

```
        SPRITE (SHOUTING, LONGSWORD DRAWN)
        No one insults my master!

        WARLOCK
        Liri, stand down.

        LIRI
        Sorry master.
```

The sprite sheathes its weapon and disappears again. The warlock also shows his true self.

```
        WARLOCK
        Sorry, he's just doing his job.
```

She's more surprised at the warlock's true form than the sprite appearing and then disappearing again. He is the total opposite of his form just a few seconds ago. She takes a few moment to compose herself and reply.

```
        FRANCINE
        Fine, I believe you. What favor are you thinking of?

        WARLOCK
        You know your way around a forest so probably just some exotic ingredients.
```

She suppresses a smile. That shouldn't be too hard.

```
        FRANCINE
        Deal! Let's meet at the cemetery tonight.
```
