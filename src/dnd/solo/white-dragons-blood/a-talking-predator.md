# White Dragon's Blood
### A Talking Predator

> **DATE** Feb 07, early morning
>
> **LOCATION** South of Phandalin
>
> Where is the dragon? Icespire Hold
> > `[1d20] = 9`

After spending the night with the gnomes, the siblings return to Phandalin using the same path they took the other day.

```
    WOMAN (WAVING AND YELLING)
    A little help?!
```

After a second looking around, Francine spots where the voice is coming from.

```
    FRANCINE (POINTING)
    There! The windmill! In the second floor!

    MIKAEL
    Let's go!
```

A large, winged monster with spiky tail is trying to destroy the windmill's front door.

```
    MONSTER
    Open this door and I will kill you swiftly.
```

The siblings look at each other: a talking monster?

Mikael casts `Thaumaturgy` on himself before speaking.

```
    MIKAEL
    Leave the woman alone!
```

The monster flies for a few feet before turning around. It locks eyes with Mikael and laughs.

```
    MONSTER
    That's a nice trick, little boy. You startled me for a bit.

    (lands a few feet from Mikael)
    Will you offer yourself in her place?

    MIKAEL
    In the name of Apollo, I command you to leave this place!
```

> Is he able to intimidate the monster? Yes
> > `DC 15 = 6 + 9 [6 + 2d6]`
> >
> > `Intimidation check: [1d20 + 0] 16 + 0 = 16 vs DC 15`

He is holding his amulet with one hand while the other one is outstretched. This stance, for some reason, scares the monster away. It flies out into the forest but not before leaving a few words.

```
    MONSTER
    We will come back for you, little boy.
```

Mikael's knees buckle and starts falling down. Good thing Francine is there to catch him.

```
    FRANCINE
    Hey, are you okay?

    MIKAEL
    Yes. I thought that wouldn't work.

    FRANCINE
    But it did. We saved her.
```

The windmill's front door opens and the woman comes out. She is holding a vial with red liquid which she offers to Mikael.

```
    WOMAN
    Come on, this should help.

    MIKAEL
    No, I'm okay. Just a bit shaken up but I'm okay.

    WOMAN
    Thank you. I hope you scared it off permanently.

    FRANCINE
    Who are you? Why are you out here by yourself?

    WOMAN
    I am Adabra. The millstone in that windmill is the only place where I can prepare my potions.

    FRANCINE
    Wait, you're also the local midwife, right? Did you know that there's a dragon out here? The town master in Phandalin wants you to go to the town.

    ADABRA
    Yes, I know of the dragon but I can't make potions in the town.

    MIKAEL
    But it is very dangerous here! If that was a dragon, we wouldn't have been able to help.

    ADABRA
    I know Chauntea will protect me.

    (looks up)
    Thank you for sending these adventurers.

    FRANCINE
    What if that... monster comes back?
```

Adabra looks at her and just smiles.

```
    ADABRA
    Why don't you come in for a while? I'll prepare a note for Harbin so he knows I'm safe. I will also tell him how you've saved me.
```

After about half an hour, Adabra's note is ready and the three are able to talk a little bit more.

```
    ADABRA
    Thank you again for saving me. Please, take this.

    FRANCINE
    Are you sure you don't want to go to town?

    ADABRA
    Yes. Here is where I should be so here is where I will stay.

    MIKAEL
    I pray Chauntea will protect you.
```

Mikael and Adabra bow down to each other as Francine is walking out the door. The siblings then continue on their journey back to Phandalin.
