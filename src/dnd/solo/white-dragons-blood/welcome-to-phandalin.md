# White Dragon's Blood
### Welcome to Phandalin

> **DATE** Feb 06
>
> **LOCATION** Phandalin

```
    DRIVER
    We're here!
```

With no one except the two of them, Francine and Mikael were able to get a good amount of sleep before arriving at their destination.

```
    FRANCINE
    Thank you so much.

    DRIVER
    Please, do everything to save our town. If you succeed, I promise to take you anywhere for free.

    (closes his eyes)
    Apollo guide you.
```

Mikael bows to the driver as he turns around. He is carrying most of their things except for her sister's weapons.

```
    FRANCINE
    Are you sure you can carry all that?

    MIKAEL
    Yes, I got this.

    FRANCINE
    Thank you. I'll go ahead and check the town.
```

On her way in, she first sees the town's general store. They have come prepared so she continue walking. She sees the two-story inn and she thinks for a second...

```
    FRANCINE (TO HERSELF)
    The sun is still up, we have a lot of time.
```

Almost next to the inn, just across the street, is what looks to be the town hall. It has stone walls, a wooden roof, and a tall bell tower at the back. Curiously, the door is closed. There are some notices at the board, all written by the same hand. The largest of the four read:

::: tip NOTICE ADVENTURERS
For any questions, knock on the house at the back.
:::

Her heart speeds up as she skims the other notices. They all mention of a dragon in the area confirming the rumors that led them here. She then goes to the house at the back of the building.

    FRANCINE (KNOCKING ON THE DOOR)
    Hello? Anyone home?

    MAN (SHOUTING THROUGH THE DOOR)
    If you're a dragon, know that I'm far too thin and bony to make a good meal!

    FRANCINE (SHOUTING THROUGH THE DOOR)
    I am not a dragon. In fact, we came here to defeat it. Can you open the door so we can talk?

    MAN
    No! I left a note in the town hall. Find the one about the rock gnomes.

    FRANCINE
    Do you know what kind of dragon it is?

    MAN
    How should I know?! Just go ask the gnomes for help if you don't want to be dragon dinner.

    FRANCINE
    Can you open the door so I can at least introduce myself properly?
```

She hears footsteps walking away from the door before she can finish her question.

```
    FRANCINE (TO HERSELF)
    Ugh! Is this how you treat people who want to help?
```

She goes back to the town hall, finds and takes the note titled `Gnomengarde Quest`.

```
    FRANCINE (WHISPERING TO HERSELF)
    Rock gnomes... mountains in the southeast... magical inventions to defeat the dragon.

    (TO HERSELF)
    Great! I hope they have something that can help us.
```

She hurries back along the trail to share the information with his brother.

    MIKAEL
    Huh? Are you sure you did not see anyone with a bow come in here.

    MAN
    Yes, I'm pretty sure. Aside from you, only my usual patrons have come through here today.

    MIKAEL (TO HIMSELF)
    Where is she?

    (TO THE MAN)
    I'm Mikael, by the way. My sister and I are here because of rumors of a dragon nearby. Do you know anything about that?

    MAN
    Pleased to meet you Mikael! I am Toblen but they call me Toby here.

    (clears his throat)
    Ah, yes. Everyone has their own version of it but, personally, I haven't seen it yet. I prefer staying inside, you see, but not like that coward of a townmaster, Harbin. He doesn't even open the door to talk to people. Coward!
```

Toby grits his teeth for a second before composing himself.

```
    TOBY
    Sorry about that, I just hate people like that. Anyway, yes, the rumors are true. There's a dragon here in Phandalin and if you want to defeat it, Stonehill Inn is the best place to stay!
```

Toby laughs at his self-promotion attempt. He knows there's only one other alternative in the area but that is probably too expensive for the guy he's talking to.

```
    MIKAEL
    Thank you. Let me just find my sister, I'll be back.
```

Just as Mikael is about to exit the inn, Francine sees him and runs towards him.

```
    FRANCINE
    I know what we need to do.

    MIKAEL
    Really?! That's fast.

    FRANCINE
    Come on!
```

Francine pulls him and they walk southeast.
