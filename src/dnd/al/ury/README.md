### Backstory

> My dearest Ury,

> Seeing you fight for nothing but entertainment is painful to watch. I always thought you'll become something more, that one day you'll use your strength for something bigger than yourself, that one day you'll aim higher than where you are right now.

> But alas, our time has run out. I can no longer wait while you chase after fame. I hope one day you get what you want.

> I will always love you.

```
        MAN
        Don't you have a fight tonight?

        URY
        These puny orcs can't do anything against me, don't worry about it.
```

The sun is up and the sky is clear but here he is, one hand holding a glass while the other is holding that same crumpled piece of paper he's held ever since he got it.

```
        MAN
        I'm not worried about you drinking, I know you can handle that.
```

With great effort, he focuses his gaze on the man.

```
        URY
        What are you implying then? Go on, say it! Say it!

        MAN
        We both know why she left and we both know what you have to do.

        URY
        Do I? DO I?!

        (stands up)
        Then why can't I leave this place?! Why can't I be the man she wants me to be?

        MAN
        You have to want it for yourself.
```

The spectators are dead silent. Usually this is the time they would be cheering for him, goading him to finish his opponent in the most spectacular way possible. But not tonight.

Tonight, he will punish. The spectators, already used to these brutal battles, are seeing ways to inflict excruciating pain that they have never seen before.

Tonight, he will kill. His opponents, battle-hardened like him, are screaming their lungs out while begging for his mercy.

Tonight, he will indulge. His blind rage, his unquenchable bloodlust, and the primal animal in him are all let loose to feast in mindless battle.

One last time.
