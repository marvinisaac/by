> **Were the kobolds responsible for the ambush? No.** (50/50, 71)

#### *(Town entrance)*

After another night of patrol looking for kobolds, the town's captain welcomes Francine. His face is a mix of anger and frustration.

```
    CAPTAIN
    A shipment was ambushed by bandits. Did you see any in the forest?

    FRANCINE
    What?! No, I didn't come across any. We've also cleared their camps in the area, right?

    CAPTAIN
    I know that's why this is a surprise. They are obviously back. Damn!

    FRANCINE
    Did we lose any men?

    CAPTAIN
    Three, all two guards and a coachman. The other managed to jump on a horse and run back. We'll have to retrieve that batch. If we miss another deadline, who knows what penalty the capital will bestow upon us.
```

Swordstone has already missed a couple of deadlines and the capital is getting angry. They are now buying the swords at a very low price and if they miss this one too, the capital might just take over the whole town and get the swords for free.

```
    CAPTAIN
    Tonight, I need you to take three guards and make another sweep at the forest. They must be there somewhere.
```
---

#### *(Somewhere in the forest, around midnight)*

Francine is leading the three guards through the dark forest. They have finished checking almost all of the old known bandit camps only to find them empty. Only two more and after those, it will be a wild hunt until the morning.

> **Are there bandits in the next camp? Yes.** (50/50, 26)
>
> **Are these the bandits they are looking for? Extreme yes!** (50/50, 4)
>
> **Interpretation:** The bandits have taken prisoners to sell as slaves.

On their way to the next camp, she becomes aware of a track that leads right to their intended destination. She signals her party to stop and come closer.

```
    FRANCINE
    There are 6 of them. I'll take point. Stay alert.
```

Francine leads the way to the next known camp. It is the ruins of a stone tower that they've been planning to completely tear down. It's a favorite of the bandits because the tower's base serves as a quick camp.

> **Stealth check succeeds!** (12 + 3 = `15 vs PP 10`)

From her position, she can see the orange glow of a small fire. Only one bandit is visible, he's standing just outside the tower's entrance. She aims at his upper torso, ready to fire as soon as he turns just a little bit towards her.

> **Francine hits Bandit 1!** (~~6~~ | 16 + 5 = `21 vs AC 12`)
>
> **Damage of 7.** (4 + 3)
> - - -
> Bandit 1: 4/11 HP

As the bandit looks in her direction, she lets loose her arrow and hits him right at his right collar bone. He shrieks in pain alerting everyone. The bloodied bandit moves back a little bit. Three more bandits become visible, two from the tower and one from the farther side. All four aim and shoot their crossbows at the rushing guards.

She shoots another arrow to finish her wounded target. The arrow finds its mark and hits him in the left collar bone this time. He falls down to his knees and down the tower's steps. The guards rush forward with their spears as the bandits fire another round of shots.

Seeing one of her comrades go down, she targets the nearest bandit aiming right at his center mass but misses. One guard finishes the job for her as they continue to trade blows.

She closes her eyes, breathes in, zeroes in on her target, and lets the arrow loose. Bam! The arrow buries itself right in his chest. All alone, the last bandit runs away but not without

Francine

**"Don't chase him, look for the swords!"**

She commands as she rushes to her fallen comrade to check if he's still alive. Checking his neck for pulse, there's still something. His armor protected all his vital organs but he took a bolt to his left elbow.

```
    FRANCINE
    Hey! Hey! Are you okay? Stay with me.
```

He briefly opens his eyes but they quickly close again.

```
    FRANCINE
    He's alive but we have to go back now! Are the swords there?
```

> **Are the swords in this camp? Yes.** (Very likely, 66)

```
    GUARD 2
    It's all here! They've also taken the guards.

    FRANCINE
    Are they okay?

    GUARD 2
    Yes. A little beaten up but alive.
```

The guards untie the prisoners. They are beaten and wounded but both are in better shape than the fallen guard outside.

```
    GUARD 3
    Can you stand up?

    PRISONER 1
    Yes. I think we can even carry some of the swords.

    FRANCINE
    Come on! We need to go back! He needs help!
```

Francine and another guard are carrying their fallen comrade, the two prisoners are carrying a crate with as many swords as they can, while the last guard is also carrying as many swords as he can.

She knows that if they get ambushed in this formation, the situation can get dire very fast but this man needs help and the shipment must be sent to the capital as soon as possible.

> **Do they encounter anything on their way back? Yes.** (50/50, 30)

She hears footsteps coming towards them. She immediately stops and signals for his companions to take cover. As gently and quickly as she could, she lays their wounded comrade down and draws her bow, aiming it at the sound's source.

> **Is it hostile? Extreme no!** (50/50, 98)
>
> **Interpretation:** They encounter Swordstone guards sent after them.

The footsteps draw nearer and as soon as the target came into view...

```
    TOM
    Woah! Franz! Easy there!
```

If it wasn't Tom's familiar face, she might have shot then and there.

```
    TOM
    The captain was getting a bit anxious so he sent us.
```

Hearing his voice, the other guards come out of cover. Tom and the guards behind him run forward as they see their wounded brothers.

```
    TOM
    How many were there? You should have brought a bigger team!

    FRANCINE
    Lecture me later, okay? For now, let's get him to town for help. We also need to go back to that tower ruins. I think half of the swords are still there.
```

Francine, Tom, and two more guards return to the ruins. The rest went back to town to get much needed medical attention.
